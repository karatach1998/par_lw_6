Move time measurement result to global variable.
-
Try to add for loop which allows to make block size 32x8 and compute 4 elements at once.
Add #define BLOCK_ROWS 8
-
Add code to kernel that perform checking for matrix with size that aren't integral multiplies of 32 on a side.
-
Run kernel in follow manner:
    uint3 blocks = dim3((m + TILE_SIZE - 1) / TILE_SIZE, (n + TILE_SIZE - 1) / TILE_SIZE);
    uint3 threads = dim3(TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE);
    transpose_optimized<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev, m, n);
-
Extend program logic to relax the requirement of equality m and n.
